|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GuSe001  | `Governance` | Meeting and Minutes preparation | Attending and hosting Meeting | [see Mom repository] | 1h | DAI |
| GuSe008 | `Reporting` | Report of Aragon Coop status week #2 | Gathering information and reporting it to the Community | https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragoncoop-two-weeks-of-operations-what-has-been-done/954/7 | 3h | DAI |
| GuSe008 | `Reporting` | Reporting Tool | Design and implementation of the DRtracer reporting tool, including here also my own time filling these reports  | https://github.com/aragoncoop/ACGP | 4h | DAI |
| GuSe009 | `Miscellaneus` | Human relationships | This week was tough in the sense that I got absorved by humans conflicts and drama that consummed lot of time (certainly more than stated here) in calls, chats and forum posts as well as mental processes, I'm unsure if this kind of effort worth to be paid so I'm requesting a different payment (in ANTs) and leave it to the community judgement. I think this is worth though, as per we are building the tools for the future Organizations, and this orgs are leaded by Humans, therefore vulnerable beings. I'm willing to prepare a post sharing insights and proposals (after things are calmed down) about how to deal with the Human factor in DAOs |  | 8h | ANT |
